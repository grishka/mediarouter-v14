This is a fork of Google's mediarouter-v7 compatibility library modified not to depend on the appcompat library and to work  with Android's native ActionBar, Fragments, etc. directly.

### Usage
Add this to your main project as a library project and use just as you would use the original mediarouter-v7. Primarily intended for Chromecast but might also work for other use cases.

### License
It's a part of AOSP so it's licensed under Apache 2.0.<br/>
